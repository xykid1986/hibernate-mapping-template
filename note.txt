Summary:

For one-to-many, many-to-one
-In unidirectional relationship, only add annotations to the Owner (one for one-to-many, many for many-to-one). In one-to-many @JoinColumns(@JoinColumn(name="",referencedColumn="")) needs to be used. In many-to-one, use @JoinColumn(name="").
-In Bidirectional relationship, as many is usually the owner, do it as said above, and add @OneToMany(mappedBy="") on one side.

For many-to-many
-In unidirectional relationship, on the owner's side use @JoinTable(name="",joinColumns=@JoinColumn(),inverseJoinColumn=@JoinColumn()). No need to add anything on non-owner's side;
-In Bidirectional relationship, just add @ManyToMany(mappedBy="").
